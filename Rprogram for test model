Above are capital constratints - Now we need to see dependency constraints 
Project 4 and 5 an mutually exclusive
maximum of 4 projects can be selected 
Project 4 depends on Project 2
Projects 1 and 3 must go together 

Decision thoughts :
  i) What combination of projects will maximize the NPV ? 
  ii) Which is the max expected NPV that can be acheived ? 

x_i = Project number 
Objective : min z sum c_i*x_i

Constratints: 
#yearly budget constratints
3x1 + x3 + 10x4 + 2x5 <= 12
5x2 + 2x3 + 4x4 <= 8
x2 + x3 + 2x4 + 5x5 <= 8
2x3 + x5 <= 4
x1+x2+x3+x4+x5 <= 4 #a maximum of 4 projects can only be selected
-x2 + x4 <= 0 #Project 4 depends on the selection of Project 2 
x1 - x3 = 0 #Project 1 and project 3 must go together

#Binary Constraint
x_i = {0,1} 0 if the project is not slected, 1 if the project is selected 

R Code: 
libarary(lpsolve)

#setting co.effecient of the objective function
f.obj <- c(2,3,1,5,4)

#matrix corresponding to the coeffecient of constraints by row
f.con <- matrix(c(3,0,1,10,2,   #capital req for year 1
